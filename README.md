- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that giraffes have very long tonguesðŸ‘€, they can reach a length of around 45 centimeters?
  Their long tongues allow them to reach leaves at the top of trees that are difficult for other animals to reach.
  In addition, giraffe tongues are also very flexible and strong, allowing them to eat leaves easily.ðŸ‘€
